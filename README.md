Sedov-Solver is a tool to produce analytical solution of a Sedov blast wave
propagating through a density gradient ρ = ρ**(-ω) in planar, cylindrical
and spherical geometry.

This tool is a FORTRAN 2003 implementation of the analytical solution described
in the report "On Efficient Generation of Numerically Robust Sedov Solutions"
by James R. Kamm and F.X. Timmes (LANL Report no. LA-UR-07-2849, 2007).
